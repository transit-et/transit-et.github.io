  content: <p>Transit Alliance of East Tennessee is only a small piece of the larger puzzle. For true quality transit in the multi-jurisdictional Knoxville region, a regional transit commission is sorely needed. With a regional transit authority, the Knoxville area can benefit from:</p><ol><li><p>Money to be set aside for longer term projects across jurisdictional lines</p></li><li><p>A governmental mediator between distinct interests of Knoxville and its less urban neighbors</p></li><li><p>Eligiblity to pursue federal funds for regional transportation improvements</p></li><li><p>Better collaborations with other regional transit authorities for best practices.</p></li></ol>
